    Allows connections to be made that may or may not require ssl.
    Somewhat surprisingly trio doesn't have an abstraction for this like
    curio even though it's fairly trivial to write. Down the line hopefully.

        host (str): Network location, either by domain or IP.
        port (int): The requested port.
        ssl (bool): Weather or not SSL is required.

            ignore them.
